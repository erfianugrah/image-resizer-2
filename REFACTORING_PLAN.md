# Image Resizer Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the Image Resizer project, tracking progress and future work items. The goal is to maintain full functionality while improving the codebase architecture, maintainability, and testability.

## Architecture Vision

We're targeting a clean architecture with:

1. **Core Domain Layer**
   - Pure business logic and models
   - Command pattern for orchestration
   - No dependencies on infrastructure

2. **Service Layer**
   - All functionality encapsulated as services
   - Abstractions via interfaces

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Implementation of service interfaces
   - Integration with Cloudflare Workers, storage, etc.

4. **Application Layer**
   - Handlers for incoming requests
   - Orchestration of services

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Client Detection Refactoring âœ…
- Moved client detection to `ClientDetectionService` from utility functions
- Updated code to use service for all client detection needs
- Removed direct utility usage and duplicated code
- This follows domain-driven design principles with proper service abstraction

### 2. Handler Extraction âœ…
- Reduced index.ts from 428 lines to 156 lines
- Created dedicated handler modules:
  - `debugHandler.ts` for debug report requests
  - `akamaiCompatibilityHandler.ts` for Akamai compatibility 
  - `imageHandler.ts` for image transformation requests
- Improved separation of concerns
- Made code more readable and maintainable

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Service Pattern Migration âœ…
- **Goal**: Move remaining utility modules into the service layer
- **Status**: Completed - All utility modules have been refactored to use the service layer
- **Progress**:
  - âœ… Implemented dedicated TransformOptions interface in services/interfaces.ts to decouple from transform.ts
  - âœ… Updated debug.ts, cache.ts, and akamai-compatibility.ts to use the new TransformOptions interface
  - âœ… Discovered existing DefaultDebugService implementation that needs completion
  - âœ… Created detailed implementation plan in docs/development/refactoring-implementation-plan.md
  - âœ… Created service refactoring documentation in docs/development/transformService-refactoring.md
  - âœ… Completed DefaultDebugService implementation to remove dependency on debug.ts
  - âœ… Completed DefaultCacheService implementation to remove dependency on cache.ts
  - âœ… Updated DefaultImageTransformationService to use CacheService instead of cache.ts utilities
  - âœ… Core application code now uses services instead of direct utility functions
  - âœ… Moved PerformanceMetrics interface from debug.ts to services/interfaces.ts
  - âœ… Updated all import statements to use the interface from its new location
  - âœ… Updated index.ts to use DebugService.setLogger instead of setDebugLogger from debug.ts
  - âœ… Updated debug.ts to use CacheService instead of importing directly from cache.ts
  - âœ… Completed updating all test files to use service interfaces and implementations
  - âœ… Removed transform.ts, debug.ts, and cache.ts as they are no longer needed
- **Outcome**: Successfully converted utility-based approach to service-oriented architecture

### 2. Service Initialization Improvements âœ…
- **Goal**: Move from ad-hoc service initialization to a more structured approach
- **Status**: Completed with service container and dependency injection
- **Implementation**:
  - Created proper dependency injection system via services container
  - Created `LoggingService` to centralize logger management
  - Updated index.ts to use LoggingService instead of direct utility calls
  - Prepared structure for migrating other utilities to services

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Goal**: Centralize configuration through service container
- **Tasks**:
  - Remove direct imports of config
  - Use configuration service exclusively
  - Implement validation/normalization of config

### 3. Error Handling Standardization
- **Goal**: Ensure consistent error creation, propagation, and handling
- **Tasks**:
  - Create domain-specific error types
  - Implement error factory pattern
  - Add contextual information to errors

### 4. Testing Framework Updates âœ…
- **Goal**: Update tests to work with the new architecture
- **Status**: In Progress - Created a comprehensive testing strategy and initial implementations
- **Progress**:
  - âœ… Created a comprehensive testing strategy in docs/development/testing-strategy.md
  - âœ… Implemented service mock factory for consistent test mocking
  - âœ… Created sample service tests for CacheService with proper isolation
  - âœ… Implemented integration test for TransformationService and CacheService
  - ðŸ”„ Updating remaining tests to use the new strategy
- **Tasks Remaining**:
  - Complete unit tests for all service implementations
  - Add integration tests for service interactions
  - Add end-to-end tests for critical paths

### 5. Documentation
- **Goal**: Improve architecture documentation
- **Tasks**:
  - Create architecture diagrams
  - Document service interactions
  - Add code examples for common operations

## Performance Considerations

Throughout the refactoring process, we must ensure:

- No regression in image processing performance
- Minimal additional memory overhead
- No increased cold start time for the worker
- Continued support for all existing features

## Progress Tracking

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Client Detection Refactoring | Complete | Moved from utils to service |
| Handler Extraction | Complete | Reduced size of index.ts |  
| Service Initialization | Complete | Using service container with LoggingService |
| Service Pattern Migration | Complete | Completed full migration to service-oriented architecture; removed utility files |
| Configuration Management | Complete | Using ConfigurationService |
| Error Handling | In Progress | Created specific error types for different services |
| Testing Updates | In Progress | Created testing strategy and sample service tests |
| Documentation | In Progress | This document is a start |

## Guidelines for Future Development

1. **Service-First**: All functionality should be implemented as services with interfaces
2. **Command Pattern**: Use commands for complex operations involving multiple services
3. **Handler Responsibilities**: Handlers should only orchestrate, not implement functionality
4. **Testing**: All new code must include tests
5. **Error Handling**: Use domain-specific errors with context

By following this plan, we will incrementally improve the codebase while maintaining functionality and performance.
