# Image Resizer Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the Image Resizer project, tracking progress and future work items. The goal is to maintain full functionality while improving the codebase architecture, maintainability, and testability.

## Architecture Vision

We're targeting a clean architecture with:

1. **Core Domain Layer**
   - Pure business logic and models
   - Command pattern for orchestration
   - No dependencies on infrastructure

2. **Service Layer**
   - All functionality encapsulated as services
   - Abstractions via interfaces

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Implementation of service interfaces
   - Integration with Cloudflare Workers, storage, etc.

4. **Application Layer**
   - Handlers for incoming requests
   - Orchestration of services

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Client Detection Refactoring ✅
- Moved client detection to `ClientDetectionService` from utility functions
- Updated code to use service for all client detection needs
- Removed direct utility usage and duplicated code
- This follows domain-driven design principles with proper service abstraction

### 2. Handler Extraction ✅
- Reduced index.ts from 428 lines to 156 lines
- Created dedicated handler modules:
  - `debugHandler.ts` for debug report requests
  - `akamaiCompatibilityHandler.ts` for Akamai compatibility 
  - `imageHandler.ts` for image transformation requests
- Improved separation of concerns
- Made code more readable and maintainable

## In-Progress Tasks

### 1. Service Pattern Migration
- **Goal**: Move remaining utility modules into the service layer
- **Status**: In progress - `LoggingService`, `StorageService`, `TransformationService`, and `DebugService` implementations underway
- **Progress**:
  - ✅ Implemented dedicated TransformOptions interface in services/interfaces.ts to decouple from transform.ts
  - ✅ Updated debug.ts, cache.ts, and akamai-compatibility.ts to use the new TransformOptions interface
  - ✅ Discovered existing DefaultDebugService implementation that needs completion
  - ✅ Created detailed implementation plan in docs/development/refactoring-implementation-plan.md
  - ✅ Created service refactoring documentation in docs/development/transformService-refactoring.md
- **Next Steps**:
  - ✅ Complete DefaultDebugService implementation to remove dependency on debug.ts
  - Complete DefaultCacheService implementation to remove dependency on cache.ts
  - Update remaining imports from transform.ts to use TransformationService
  - Eventually remove transform.ts once all dependencies have been migrated

## Completed Tasks

### 3. Service Initialization Improvements ✅
- **Goal**: Move from ad-hoc service initialization to a more structured approach
- **Status**: Completed with service container and dependency injection
- **Implementation**:
  - Created proper dependency injection system via services container
  - Created `LoggingService` to centralize logger management
  - Updated index.ts to use LoggingService instead of direct utility calls
  - Prepared structure for migrating other utilities to services

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Goal**: Centralize configuration through service container
- **Tasks**:
  - Remove direct imports of config
  - Use configuration service exclusively
  - Implement validation/normalization of config

### 3. Error Handling Standardization
- **Goal**: Ensure consistent error creation, propagation, and handling
- **Tasks**:
  - Create domain-specific error types
  - Implement error factory pattern
  - Add contextual information to errors

### 4. Testing Framework Updates
- **Goal**: Update tests to work with the new architecture
- **Tasks**:
  - Create mock implementations of services
  - Fix existing tests to use service architecture
  - Add tests for new components

### 5. Documentation
- **Goal**: Improve architecture documentation
- **Tasks**:
  - Create architecture diagrams
  - Document service interactions
  - Add code examples for common operations

## Performance Considerations

Throughout the refactoring process, we must ensure:

- No regression in image processing performance
- Minimal additional memory overhead
- No increased cold start time for the worker
- Continued support for all existing features

## Progress Tracking

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Client Detection Refactoring | Complete | Moved from utils to service |
| Handler Extraction | Complete | Reduced size of index.ts |  
| Service Initialization | Complete | Using service container with LoggingService |
| Service Pattern Migration | In Progress | LoggingService, StorageService, TransformationService, and DebugService implementations complete; TransformOptions interface decoupled from transform.ts |
| Configuration Management | Complete | Using ConfigurationService |
| Error Handling | In Progress | Created specific error types for different services |
| Testing Updates | Planned | Fix and enhance tests |
| Documentation | In Progress | This document is a start |

## Guidelines for Future Development

1. **Service-First**: All functionality should be implemented as services with interfaces
2. **Command Pattern**: Use commands for complex operations involving multiple services
3. **Handler Responsibilities**: Handlers should only orchestrate, not implement functionality
4. **Testing**: All new code must include tests
5. **Error Handling**: Use domain-specific errors with context

By following this plan, we will incrementally improve the codebase while maintaining functionality and performance.
