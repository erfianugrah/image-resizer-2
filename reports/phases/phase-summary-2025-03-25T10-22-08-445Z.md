## Implications

- **Phase 1 (Non-Invasive Optimizations)**: These optimizations focus on reducing logging overhead and optimizing response handling without architectural changes.
- **Phase 2 (Architecture Optimizations)**: These introduce lazy service initialization and optimized client detection to reduce cold start time and improve request processing efficiency.
- **Phase 3 (Major Performance Enhancements)**: These implement parallel storage operations and tiered caching to significantly reduce response time and improve resource efficiency.
