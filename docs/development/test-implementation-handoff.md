# Test Implementation Handoff Document

## Current Status

We've completed the foundational work for implementing a service-oriented testing strategy for the image-resizer-2 project:

1. Created a comprehensive testing strategy document (`docs/development/testing-strategy.md`)
2. Implemented service mock factories (`test/mocks/serviceMockFactory.ts`)
3. Created sample implementation tests:
   - `test/services/cacheService.spec.ts` (Unit test)
   - `test/integration/transform-cache.spec.ts` (Integration test)
   - `test/domain/commands/transformImageCommand.spec.ts` (Domain test)
4. Documented service testing guidelines (`docs/development/service-test-guidelines.md`)
5. Updated the refactoring plan to reflect testing progress

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Implement remaining service unit tests**:
   - [ ] `test/services/transformationService.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/services/clientDetectionService.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/services/debugService.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/services/configurationService.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/services/loggingService.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/services/storageService.spec.ts`

2. **Create additional integration tests**:
   - [ ] `test/integration/storage-transform.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/integration/transform-client.spec.ts`

3. **Update handler tests**:
   - [ ] `test/handlers/imageHandler.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/handlers/debugHandler.spec.ts`
   - [ ] `test/handlers/akamaiCompatibilityHandler.spec.ts`

### Guidelines for Implementation

1. **Service Unit Tests**:
   - Follow the pattern from `cacheService.spec.ts`
   - Test each method in isolation
   - Mock all dependencies
   - Cover both success and error paths
   - Use the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interactions between two services
   - Verify correct method calls and parameter passing
   - Use real implementations of relevant services
   - Mock external dependencies (e.g., Cloudflare APIs)

3. **Mock Usage**:
   - Use the `serviceMockFactory.ts` for consistent mocking
   - Override mock behavior for specific test cases
   - Reset mocks between tests

## Test Implementation Priority

### High Priority

1. `transformationService.spec.ts` - Core functionality
2. `storageService.spec.ts` - Critical for image fetching
3. `clientDetectionService.spec.ts` - Essential for optimal transformations

### Medium Priority

1. `debugService.spec.ts` - Important for diagnostics
2. Remaining service tests
3. Integration tests

### Low Priority

1. Handler tests - Already covered by integration tests to some extent
2. End-to-end tests - Will be implemented after all service tests are complete

## Example Approach

For each service test:

1. Create the test file structure following the example in `cacheService.spec.ts`
2. Implement setup code to instantiate the service with mocked dependencies
3. Group tests by method using nested `describe` blocks
4. Implement tests for success cases, error cases, and edge cases
5. Verify both the return value and side effects (e.g., logging, dependency calls)

## Resources

- `docs/development/testing-strategy.md` - Overall testing approach
- `docs/development/service-test-guidelines.md` - Specific patterns and examples
- `test/mocks/serviceMockFactory.ts` - Mock implementations
- `test/services/cacheService.spec.ts` - Reference implementation

## Final Notes

- Focus on behavior testing rather than implementation details
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on each other
- Use proper mocking to avoid testing dependencies
- Remember to test error handling thoroughly

Following this implementation plan will complete the testing suite for the image-resizer-2 service-oriented architecture.
