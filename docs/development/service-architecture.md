# Image Resizer Service Architecture

## Overview

The Image Resizer employs a service-oriented architecture organized around clear domains of responsibility. Each service handles a specific aspect of the application's functionality, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Service Isolation**: Services have well-defined boundaries and responsibilities
2. **Interface-Based Design**: All services implement interfaces that define their contract
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services receive their dependencies through constructor injection
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Services have controlled initialization and shutdown phases
5. **Error Encapsulation**: Services catch and translate domain-specific errors
6. **Stateless Operation**: Services are designed to be stateless where possible
7. **Observability**: Services provide metrics and diagnostics capabilities

### LifecycleManagerService

- **Responsibility**: Coordinate service lifecycle events
- **Key Features**:
  - Dependency-based initialization
  - Reverse-order shutdown
  - Health monitoring
  - Graceful degradation
  - Timeout management
- **Lifecycle**:
  - Self-managed with detailed statistics tracking

## Service Container

The ServiceContainer acts as a registry for all services, providing:

1. **Centralized Access**: Single point of access to all services
2. **Lifecycle Coordination**: Manages initialization and shutdown
3. **Dependency Resolution**: Ensures services have their dependencies
4. **Lazy Loading**: Services can be loaded only when needed

## Lifecycle Management

All services implement a standard lifecycle pattern:

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Resource acquisition
   - Connection establishment
   - Configuration validation
   - Baseline metrics collection

2. **Operational Phase**:
   - Regular service operation
   - Statistics collection
   - Health monitoring

3. **Shutdown Phase**:
   - Resource release
   - Connection termination
   - Statistics reporting
   - State persistence (if needed)

The LifecycleManager coordinates these phases across all services, ensuring:

- Services are initialized in dependency order
- Services are shut down in reverse dependency order
- Failures are handled gracefully
- Proper timeout management is applied
- Health status is tracked and reported

## Error Handling

Each service domain has its own error types that:

1. Extend from common base error classes
2. Include relevant context information
3. Provide appropriate HTTP status codes
4. Support error translation and aggregation

## Resilience Patterns

Services implement various resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide alternatives when primary options fail
3. **Retry Logic**: Attempt operations multiple times with backoff
4. **Timeout Management**: Prevent operations from hanging indefinitely
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue functioning with reduced capabilities

## Service Interactions

Services interact through well-defined interfaces:

1. **Direct Method Calls**: For synchronous in-process interactions
2. **Async Operations**: For non-blocking operations
3. **Event-Based Communication**: For loosely coupled interactions
4. **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating operations

## Configuration Dependence

Services follow a configuration hierarchy:

1. **Default Configuration**: Baseline configuration
2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific overrides
3. **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime adjustments

## Observability

Services provide various observability mechanisms:

1. **Logging**: Structured logs with context
2. **Metrics**: Performance and operational metrics
3. **Health Status**: Current service health
4. **Diagnostics**: Detailed operational information

## Future Enhancements

1. **Service Registry**: Dynamic service discovery and registration
2. **Enhanced Health Monitoring**: Real-time health dashboards
3. **Automated Dependency Analysis**: Generate dependency graphs
4. **Service Versioning**: Track and manage service versioning
5. **Resource Governance**: Monitor and control resource usage
