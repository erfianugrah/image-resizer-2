# Cache Logging Enhancements

This document outlines the recently implemented cache logging enhancements and future planned improvements.

## Background

The image-resizer cache system was experiencing two key issues:

1. **Content Type Recognition**: Response data stored as binary in KV was not being properly recognized as an image, leading to cache misses and redundant processing.

2. **Redundant Aspect Crop Processing**: The system was recalculating metadata even when it was already processed and stored in the KV cache.

To address these issues and provide better visibility into cache operations, we implemented enhanced logging throughout the cache system.

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. Integrated Logging with SimpleKVTransformCacheManager

Previously, SimpleKVTransformCacheManager used direct console calls, which:
- Were inconsistent with the rest of the codebase's logging patterns
- Lacked structured metadata for debugging and analysis
- Made it difficult to trace operations across components

We've now:
- Updated SimpleKVTransformCacheManager to accept a Logger parameter
- Modified KVTransformCacheManagerFactory to pass its logger to SimpleKVTransformCacheManager
- Added helper methods for consistent logging with console fallback for backward compatibility
- Added performance tracking with duration measurements

### 2. Standardized Cache Operation Logging

All cache operations now include standardized log fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `operation` | Type of operation | `"kv_get"`, `"kv_put"`, `"kv_delete"` |
| `result` | Operation result | `"hit"`, `"miss"`, `"write"`, `"error"` |
| `key` | Cache key | `"transform:image.jpg:w800:webp:1a2b3c4d"` |
| `reason` | Context for misses/errors | `"not_found"`, `"invalid_content_type"` |
| `url` | Request URL | `"https://example.com/image.jpg?width=800"` |
| `durationMs` | Operation time (ms) | `42` |

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Visibility

We've improved error logging to capture important details:

```
KV transform cache: Error retrieving cache item {
  operation: 'kv_get',
  result: 'error',
  key: 'transform:image.jpg:w800:webp:1a2b3c4d',
  url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg?width=800',
  path: '/image.jpg',
  durationMs: 42,
  error: 'Unexpected end of data',
  stack: '...'
}
```

### 4. Performance Metrics

All key cache operations now track and log performance metrics:

- Operation duration is measured using high-precision timestamps
- Long-running operations (>100ms) are logged at WARN level for visibility
- Cache hits and misses are tracked for statistics

## Specific Improvements

### Content Type Validation in get() Method

Enhanced the content type validation with detailed logging:

```typescript
if (!result.metadata.contentType.startsWith('image/')) {
  this.stats.misses++;
  this.logWarn("KV transform cache: Retrieved cache item has non-image content type", {
    operation: 'kv_get',
    result: 'miss',
    reason: 'invalid_content_type',
    key,
    contentType: result.metadata.contentType,
    url: url.toString(),
    path: url.pathname,
    durationMs: duration
  });
  return null;
}
```

### Cache Hit/Miss Tracking

Improved cache hit/miss tracking with detailed information:

```typescript
// Cache hit - log success with detailed info
this.stats.hits++;
this.logDebug("KV transform cache: Cache hit", {
  operation: 'kv_get',
  result: 'hit',
  key,
  contentType: result.metadata.contentType,
  size: result.metadata.size,
  url: url.toString(),
  path: url.pathname,
  durationMs: duration,
  age: Date.now() - (result.metadata.timestamp || 0),
  ttl: result.metadata.ttl,
  transformOptions: typeof transformOptions === 'object' ? 
    Object.keys(transformOptions).join(',') : 'none'
});
```

## Planned Future Enhancements

We plan to extend these logging improvements to additional methods and components:

1. **Complete SimpleKVTransformCacheManager Updates**
   - Enhance remaining methods (put, delete, purge) with improved logging
   - Add breadcrumb support for long-running operations

2. **Comprehensive Performance Metrics**
   - Implement cache efficiency metrics (hit ratio, size savings)
   - Add detailed timing breakdowns for complex operations
   - Create aggregated metrics for monitoring and alerting

3. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - Develop a debug UI for cache performance visualization
   - Add log-based analytics for cache usage patterns
   - Implement cache health monitoring and recommendations

4. **Advanced Caching Optimizations**
   - Use logged metrics to dynamically adjust TTLs
   - Implement predictive precaching based on usage patterns
   - Add adaptive cache invalidation strategies

## Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1 (Completed): Basic logging infrastructure and key method improvements
- Phase 2 (Next 2 weeks): Complete all method enhancements and add breadcrumb support
- Phase 3 (Next month): Implement comprehensive metrics and visualization
- Phase 4 (Future): Advanced optimizations based on collected metrics

## Conclusion

The enhanced logging infrastructure provides significantly improved visibility into cache operations, enabling better debugging, performance monitoring, and optimization. These changes will help us identify and resolve cache-related issues more quickly, improving overall system performance and reliability.
