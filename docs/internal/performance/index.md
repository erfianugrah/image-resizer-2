# Performance Optimization Documentation

This section documents performance optimization strategies, measurements, and recommendations for the Image Resizer.

## Optimization Strategies

- [Performance Optimization Recommendations](performance-optimization-recommendations.md) - General performance recommendations
- [Metadata Caching Strategy](metadata-caching-strategy.md) - Optimizing metadata handling through caching
- [Aspect Crop Metadata Optimization](aspect-crop-metadata-optimization.md) - Optimizing aspect ratio operations

## Service-Specific Optimizations

- [Client Detection Optimization](client-detection-optimization.md) - Optimizing the client detection process

## Performance Testing

When implementing and documenting performance optimizations:

1. Establish baseline performance metrics before optimization
2. Define specific optimization goals (response time, throughput, etc.)
3. Document the technical approach and implementation details
4. Measure and report performance improvements with data
5. Document any trade-offs made (memory usage, complexity, etc.)
