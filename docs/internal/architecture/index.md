# Architecture Documentation

This section contains high-level architectural documentation, design decisions, and improvement plans for the Image Resizer.

## Architecture Overview

- [Functional Verification](functional-verification.md) - Verification of functional requirements and capabilities
- [Improvement Plan](improvement-plan.md) - Comprehensive plan for ongoing improvements

## Architectural Decision Records

Architectural decisions should be documented with the following structure:

1. **Title** - Clear problem statement
2. **Context** - Explanation of the forces at play
3. **Decision** - The response to these forces
4. **Status** - Current state (proposed, accepted, deprecated, etc.)
5. **Consequences** - Impact of the decision

## Architecture Evolution

The Image Resizer architecture continues to evolve toward:

1. **Service-oriented design** - Well-defined services with clear responsibilities
2. **Domain-driven design** - Core domain logic separated from infrastructure concerns
3. **Command pattern** - Encapsulating operations as commands
4. **Performance optimization** - Continuous performance improvements
5. **Operational excellence** - Monitoring, reliability, and maintainability
