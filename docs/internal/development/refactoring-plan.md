# Image Resizer Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the Image Resizer project to improve architecture, maintainability, and performance.

## 1. Service Lifecycle Management

### 1.1 Add Service Lifecycle Methods ✅
- Add initialize() and shutdown() methods to all service interfaces
- Implement these methods in all service implementations
- Update ServiceContainer to coordinate lifecycle

### 1.2 Service Statistics and Resource Tracking ✅
- Add statistics tracking to all services
- Track resource usage during service lifetime
- Implement proper cleanup in shutdown methods

### 1.3 Implement Centralized Lifecycle Manager ✅
- Create LifecycleManager service to coordinate initialization and shutdown
- Implement dependency-based initialization order
- Implement reverse-order shutdown
- Add health monitoring and reporting
- Support graceful degradation and timeout management

### 1.4 Add Health Monitoring API
- Create endpoint for health status reporting
- Expose service statistics and health information
- Add operational monitoring dashboard

## 2. Error Handling and Resilience

### 2.1 Standardize Error Types ✅
- Create domain-specific error classes for each service
- Implement proper error hierarchies
- Add context information to errors

### 2.2 Implement Circuit Breakers ✅
- Add circuit breaker pattern to external service calls
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Track failure rates and recovery

### 2.3 Add Request Retry Logic ✅
- Implement retry with exponential backoff
- Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Configure retry limits and timeouts

### 2.4 Improve Error Reporting
- Enhance error logging with structured data
- Add correlation IDs for request tracing
- Implement error aggregation and reporting

## 3. Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Response Optimization ✅
- Implement optimized response creation
- Add proper cache headers based on content
- Optimize response streaming

### 3.2 Lazy Service Initialization ✅
- Create lazy loading container
- Initialize services only when needed
- Track initialization performance

### 3.3 Request Processing Pipeline
- Create middleware pipeline architecture
- Split request handling into composable stages
- Optimize critical path

### 3.4 Memory Usage Optimization
- Implement memory usage monitoring
- Optimize buffer handling
- Add memory limits and tracking

## 4. Testing Improvements

### 4.1 Enhanced Unit Tests ✅
- Improve test coverage for all services
- Add lifecycle method testing
- Test error handling and edge cases

### 4.2 Integration Tests ✅
- Create end-to-end tests for main workflows
- Test service interactions
- Verify correct error handling

### 4.3 Performance Tests
- Implement benchmarking framework
- Create baseline performance tests
- Add regression testing for performance

### 4.4 Chaos Testing
- Add fault injection capabilities
- Test system under degraded conditions
- Verify resilience mechanisms

## 5. Developer Experience

### 5.1 Improve Documentation ✅
- Enhance code documentation with JSDoc
