# CachePerformanceManager Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the new `CachePerformanceManager` module as part of the final phase of the CacheService refactoring. This module will be responsible for performance-related functionality, including metrics recording and resource hints.

## Functionality

The `CachePerformanceManager` will handle:

1. Recording cache metrics for monitoring purposes
2. Adding resource hints to responses for improved client-side performance

## Implementation Details

### Interface

```typescript
interface CachePerformanceManagerInterface {
  /**
   * Record cache metrics for monitoring
   * 
   * @param request The original request
   * @param response The response
   * @returns Promise that resolves when metrics have been recorded
   */
  recordCacheMetric(request: Request, response: Response): Promise<void>;
  
  /**
   * Add resource hints to a response for performance optimization
   * 
   * @param response The response to enhance
   * @param request The original request
   * @param options The transformation options
   * @param storageResult The storage result
   * @returns The enhanced response
   */
  addResourceHints(
    response: Response,
    request: Request,
    options?: TransformOptions,
    storageResult?: StorageResult
  ): Response;
}
```

### File Structure

- `/src/services/cache/CachePerformanceManager.ts` - Main implementation
- `/test/services/cache/CachePerformanceManager.test.ts` - Unit tests

### Integration with CacheService

The `CacheService` will create an instance of the `CachePerformanceManager` in its constructor:

```typescript
this.performanceManager = new CachePerformanceManager(logger, configService);
```

And will delegate performance-related operations to this module:

```typescript
async recordCacheMetric(request: Request, response: Response): Promise<void> {
  return this.performanceManager.recordCacheMetric(request, response);
}

addResourceHints(
  response: Response,
  request: Request,
  options?: TransformOptions,
  storageResult?: StorageResult
): Response {
  return this.performanceManager.addResourceHints(response, request, options, storageResult);
}
```

## Test Plan

The unit tests will verify:

1. Proper recording of metrics
2. Correct addition of preconnect and preload hints
3. Handling of different response types (HTML vs. non-HTML)
4. Error handling

## Future Extensions

In the future, the `CachePerformanceManager` could be extended to include:

1. More advanced metrics collection
2. Integration with monitoring tools
3. Adaptive hint generation based on access patterns
4. Client-side performance optimization recommendations
