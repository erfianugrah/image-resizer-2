# Service-Oriented Testing Strategy for Image Resizer

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Image Resizer service-oriented architecture. The strategy is designed to ensure that all services and their interactions are properly tested, both in isolation and integration, to maintain high code quality and prevent regressions.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test in Isolation**: Each service should be tested in isolation with properly mocked dependencies.
2. **Test Interfaces**: Tests should verify that implementations fulfill their interfaces.
3. **Test Integration**: Service interactions should be tested to ensure proper collaboration.
4. **Test Error Handling**: Error cases should be thoroughly tested to ensure robust error handling.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Unusual or boundary cases should be tested to ensure reliability.
6. **Test Performance**: Critical paths should be tested for performance where applicable.

## Testing Structure

The testing structure will follow the service architecture and be organized as follows:

```

├── services/            # Unit tests for service implementations
│   ├── cacheService.spec.ts
│   ├── clientDetectionService.spec.ts
│   ├── configurationService.spec.ts
│   ├── debugService.spec.ts
│   ├── loggingService.spec.ts
│   ├── serviceContainer.spec.ts
│   ├── storageService.spec.ts
│   └── transformationService.spec.ts
├── domain/              # Tests for domain objects and commands
│   ├── commands/

│   ├── serviceFactory.ts
│   ├── requestFactory.ts
│   └── ...
└── utils/               # Test utilities
    ├── testHelpers.ts
    └── ...
```

## Mock Utilities

A set of standardized mock factories will be created to ensure consistent test mocking:

1. **ServiceMockFactory**: Creates consistent mock implementations of each service interface
2. **RequestMockFactory**: Builds mock Request objects with standardized methods
3. **ResponseMockFactory**: Creates mock Response objects
4. **EnvMockFactory**: Creates mock environment objects for Cloudflare Workers
5. **ConfigMockFactory**: Creates mock configuration objects

## Testing Approach by Service

### ConfigurationService

**Test Focus**:
- Loading and parsing configuration
- Environment-specific configuration
- Configuration merging and overrides
- Feature flag system

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests of individual methods
- Tests with different environment variables
- Tests with overridden configuration

### LoggingService

**Test Focus**:
- Logger creation and context management
- Log level filtering
- Structured logging format

**Testing Strategy**:
- Mock log output and verify format
- Test log level filtering
- Test contextual logging

### CacheService

**Test Focus**:
- Cache header generation
- Cache API integration
- TTL calculation
- Cache tag generation
- Cache bypass logic
- Error handling and resilience patterns

**Testing Strategy**:
- Mock Cache API and verify interactions
- Test TTL calculation with different content types
- Test cache tag generation with different inputs
- Test error handling with simulated failures
- Test circuit breaker pattern

### StorageService

**Test Focus**:
- Image fetching from different sources
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling for fetch failures
- Content type detection
- Metadata extraction

**Testing Strategy**:
- Mock fetch and verify correct handling
- Test authentication header generation
- Test error handling with different failure modes
- Test content type detection logic

### TransformationService

**Test Focus**:
- URL transformation parameter parsing
- Cloudflare Image Resizing integration
- Responsive image transformations
- Format optimization
- Client-adaptive optimizations

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test transformation option generation
- Test URL parameter parsing
- Test responsive breakpoint calculations
- Test format selection based on client capabilities
- Test image quality optimization

### ClientDetectionService

**Test Focus**:
- Client capability detection
- Browser feature detection
- Device classification
- Network quality estimation

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test with different User-Agent strings
- Test with different client hint headers
- Test device classification logic
- Test format support detection

### DebugService

**Test Focus**:
- Debug header generation
- HTML report generation
- Debug mode detection
- Performance metrics collection

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test debug header format
- Test HTML report content
- Test debug mode detection logic
- Test performance metric calculation

## Integration Testing Strategy

Integration tests will focus on service interactions:

1. **Storage to Transformation**: Test the flow from storage service to transformation service
2. **Transformation to Cache**: Test caching of transformed images
3. **Client Detection to Transformation**: Test how client detection affects transformations
4. **End-to-End Flow**: Test the complete request flow through all services

## Test Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Create mock factories and test utilities
   - Create service mock factory
   - Create request and response mock factories
   - Create test helpers

2. **Phase 2**: Implement service unit tests
   - Start with ConfigurationService tests
   - Implement CacheService tests
   - Implement StorageService tests
   - Implement remaining service tests

3. **Phase 3**: Implement domain and handler tests
   - Test command implementations
   - Test handler logic

4. **Phase 4**: Implement integration tests
   - Test key service interactions
   - Test end-to-end flows

## Test Doubles Strategy

1. **Stubs**: Use for providing test data
2. **Spies**: Use for verifying method calls
3. **Mocks**: Use for verifying complex interactions
4. **Fakes**: Use for complex dependencies like Cache API

## Best Practices

1. **Test Setup**: Each test should have minimal, focused setup
2. **Isolated Tests**: Tests should not depend on other tests
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Test names should describe the behavior being tested
4. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert pattern for clear test structure
5. **Focus on Behavior**: Test behavior, not implementation details
6. **Clean Teardown**: Tests should clean up after themselves

## Continuous Integration

Tests will be integrated into the CI pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit**: Run unit tests on pre-commit
2. **CI Build**: Run all tests on CI build
3. **Coverage**: Track and maintain test coverage
4. **Performance**: Track and report test performance

## Maintenance Strategy

1. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and update tests
2. **Test Refactoring**: Refactor tests when implementation changes
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Identify and address coverage gaps
4. **Test Performance**: Monitor and optimize test performance

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to testing the Image Resizer service-oriented architecture and ensures high-quality, reliable code.
