# Detector Framework Integration

This document describes the integration of the unified Client Detection framework into the transform pipeline.

## Overview

The Client Detection framework provides a consolidated approach to detecting browser capabilities, network conditions, and device characteristics. It uses a strategy pattern to prioritize different detection methods with proper fallbacks. This integration connects the detector to the transform pipeline to optimize image transformation options based on client capabilities.

## Changes Made

1. **Imported the detector in transform.ts**
   - Added import for detector and setLogger
   - Updated setLogger function to configure the detector's logger

2. **Replaced direct browser detection**
   - Removed getBrowserInfo and detectFormatSupportFromBrowser functions
   - Updated getFormat function to use the unified detector

3. **Made buildTransformOptions async**
   - Updated function signature to return Promise<TransformOptions>
   - Used detector.getOptimizedOptions to get optimized transformation options
   - Added metrics collection and logging for performance monitoring

4. **Updated transformImage**
   - Modified to handle the async buildTransformOptions

5. **Updated tests**
   - Replaced browser-detection.spec.ts to test the detector integration
   - Added new detector-integration.spec.ts to test transform integration

6. **Updated documentation**
   - Marked the integration as complete in CLIENT_DETECTION_PLAN.md
   - Created DETECTOR_INTEGRATION.md for detailed documentation

## Benefits

- **Unified Detection**: Single source of truth for client capability detection
- **Improved Caching**: Detection results are cached to improve performance
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Strategy pattern ensures reliable detection with graceful degradation
- **Better Metrics**: Added performance metrics for monitoring and debugging
- **Future Extensibility**: New detection methods can be added easily as strategies

## Usage

The detector is used in the transform pipeline automatically. When images are requested:

1. The detector analyzes the request using various strategies
2. Detection results are cached for subsequent requests
3. Format, quality, and dimensions are optimized based on client capabilities
4. Metrics are collected for performance monitoring

## Testing

The integration has been tested with:

- Unit tests for detector functions
- Integration tests for transform + detector interactions
- Tests for browser detection accuracy
- Type checking to ensure type safety

All tests are passing and typechecking is successful.

## Next Steps

The client detection framework is fully integrated with the transform pipeline. Possible future enhancements:

1. Add telemetry for tracking format distribution and optimization effectiveness
2. Implement automatic detector cache clearing based on memory usage
3. Add more device-specific optimizations based on collected metrics
4. Extend the detector to handle video format and quality detection
