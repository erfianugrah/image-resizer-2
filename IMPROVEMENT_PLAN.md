- [ ] Enhance path transformation caching
- [ ] Add image metadata caching layer
- [ ] Implement prefetch for popular image derivatives
- [ ] Optimize parallel fetch operations

### 3. Enhance Logging Performance
- [ ] Further optimize Pino logger with stream-based processing
- [ ] Implement sampling for high-volume log events
- [ ] Add structured log filtering at source
- [ ] Optimize log serialization for performance
- [ ] Add log compression for high-volume environments

### 4. Implement Worker-Level Caching
- [ ] Add global in-memory LRU cache for hot paths
- [ ] Cache derivative configurations
- [ ] Implement transformation result caching
