Okay, let's break down the performance improvements step-by-step based on the logs and the code files you provided.

**1. Optimize KV Transform Cache Lookups for `format=json`**

* **Problem:** The logs clearly show that when a request like `?format=json` comes in, the cache lookup checks multiple image format keys sequentially (`json`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `webp`) in the KV store (`IMAGE_TRANSFORMATIONS_CACHE`). This adds significant latency (over 400ms in the example) because metadata requests shouldn't use the KV transform cache at all.
* **File:** `src/services/cache/kv/SimpleKVTransformCacheManager.ts`
* **Analysis:** The `get` and `isCached` methods in `SimpleKVTransformCacheManager.ts` implement a format prioritization strategy that checks multiple formats. However, metadata is handled by the `metadataService` with its own caching mechanism, and the `put` method already correctly skips storing JSON metadata in the KV transform cache. The `get` and `isCached` methods should also skip processing for `format=json` requests entirely.
* **Solution:**
    * **Modify `get` and `isCached` methods:** Before any KV lookups, add an early return for JSON requests:
        ```typescript
        // Inside get() and isCached() methods
        const url = new URL(request.url);
        const requestedFormatParam = url.searchParams.get('format'); // Check URL param directly
        const requestedOptionsFormat = transformOptions.format;

        if (requestedFormatParam === 'json' || requestedOptionsFormat === 'json') {
          this.logDebug('KV transform cache: Skipping lookup for format=json request', { 
            operation: 'kv_json_bypass',
            url: url.toString() 
          });
          // Return immediately for JSON requests - these are handled by the metadata service
          // For isCached(): return false;
          // For get(): return null;
        }
        
        // ... (rest of the existing format prioritization logic for non-JSON requests)
        ```
    * **Impact:** This will completely bypass unnecessary KV transform cache operations for metadata requests, eliminating the latency overhead for `format=json` requests.

**2. Reduce Logging Verbosity in Production**

* **Problem:** The logs show `DEBUG: "true"` is active (from deployment logs) and the configuration confirms `logging.level: "DEBUG"`. This generates excessive logs (`BREADCRUMB`, `DEBUG` messages) in production, consuming CPU time and potentially obscuring important information.
* **Files:**
    * `config/modules/core.json` (or KV override for this module)
    * `wrangler.toml` (or `.jsonc`/`.env` depending on your setup) [cite: 9 - not found, but typical location]
* **Solution:**
    * **Option A (Config Module):** In your KV store or the `config/modules/core.json` file, change the `logging.level` for the production environment configuration from `"DEBUG"` to `"INFO"` or `"WARN"`.
    * **Option B (Environment Variable):** In your `wrangler.toml` (or equivalent) [cite: 9 - not found], ensure the `[vars]` section for your production environment sets `DEBUG = "false"`. The `ConfigurationService` likely uses this environment variable.
    * **Recommendation:** Use **Option A** for more granular control via the configuration system. Option B might be a quick override.
* **Impact:** Reduces CPU usage, lowers log ingestion costs (if applicable), and makes production logs cleaner and focused on important events or errors.

**3. Optimize Logger Initialization**

* **Problem:** The logs show many "Created new logger for context: ..." messages during the initial startup phase. This suggests loggers might be created eagerly when the service container starts, even if not all services are used in a particular request.
* **Files:**
    * `src/services/loggingService.ts`
    * `src/services/containerFactory.ts` (or `src/services/serviceContainer.ts` / `src/services/lazyServiceContainer.ts` depending on which is used)
* **Analysis:** The `DefaultLoggingService`'s `getLogger` method caches logger instances, which is good. However, the instantiation of services in `containerFactory.ts` or `serviceContainer.ts` might be calling `getLogger` during their own construction, leading to upfront creation.
* **Solution:**
    * **Ensure Lazy Creation:** Review the constructors of your services (e.g., `StorageService`, `TransformationService`, etc.). Instead of calling `loggingService.getLogger(context)` directly in the constructor, consider getting the logger only when it's first needed within a method.
    * **Alternatively (If using DI):** If your dependency injection setup supports it, configure the `LoggingService` or individual loggers to be injected lazily or as factory functions.
    * **Check Container:** Verify in `containerFactory.ts` or the relevant container implementation that services aren't unnecessarily requesting loggers during the container build phase itself.
* **Impact:** Reduces the work done during initial worker startup/request initialization, potentially improving cold start times slightly and reducing initial log noise.

**4. Optimize Configuration Loading**

* **Problem:** The logs contain repeated "BREADCRUMB: Getting complete configuration" messages within a single request lifecycle. This *could* indicate that `configurationService.getConfig()` is called multiple times.
* **Files:**
    * `src/index.ts`
    * `src/services/configurationService.ts`
    * Other services that might use configuration (e.g., `TransformationService`, `CacheService`).
* **Analysis:** The `DefaultConfigurationService` loads the config once during its own initialization. However, if different services or handlers repeatedly call `configurationService.getConfig()` within the *same request*, it might involve redundant lookups or processing, even if the underlying config object is cached.
* **Solution:**
    * **Fetch Once Per Request:** In the main request handler (`src/index.ts` `Workspace` method), call `configurationService.getConfig()` *once* after the container is created.
    * **Pass Config Down:** Pass the resulting `config` object as an argument to the handlers (`handleImageRequest`, etc.) and any services that need it, rather than having them retrieve it again from the service.
        ```typescript
        // In src/index.ts fetch method
        const services = await createContainer(env, { initializeServices: true });
        const config = services.configurationService.getConfig(); // Get config ONCE
        const performanceBaseline = initializePerformanceBaseline(config, services.logger);
        // ... other initializations

        // ... later in try block
        // Pass config to handlers
        let finalResponse = await handleImageRequest(request, url, services, metrics, config);
        // ...
        ```
* **Impact:** Ensures configuration is accessed efficiently within each request, avoiding potential minor overhead from repeated function calls or object lookups.

**5. `format=json` Metadata Fetch (Acknowledged)**

* **Your Point:** You confirmed that using `cf.image` (via `Workspace` with `cf` options) for `format=json` requests is intentional because it's how you retrieve image dimensions directly from Cloudflare's image processing.
* **Conclusion:** No change is needed here. This approach is valid. My previous suggestion to bypass it was based on the assumption that metadata might be available elsewhere, but using `cf.image` is a direct way to get Cloudflare-processed metadata.

**6. Investigate `API_KEY` Warning**

* **Problem:** The log shows `(warn) Environment variable not found: API_KEY`. You mentioned it might only be used for config loading.
* **Files:**
    * `src/services/config/KVConfigStore.ts`
    * `src/services/configurationService.ts`
    * `src/services/authService.ts` (if used for KV access)
    * Code related to accessing the `IMAGE_CONFIGURATION_STORE` KV binding.
* **Analysis:** Cloudflare KV access via bindings typically *doesn't* require a separate API key when accessed from within a Worker. The binding itself grants permission. This warning could stem from:
    * **Legacy Code:** Code attempting to read `env.API_KEY` that is no longer needed for KV access via bindings.
    * **Configuration API Auth:** The Configuration API (`/api/config` routes handled by `configApiHandler.ts`) might require authentication, potentially via an API key checked in `configAuthMiddleware.ts`. If `DISABLE_CONFIG_AUTH` is `"false"` (as per your logs), this middleware might be looking for `env.API_KEY`.
    * **Other Service:** An unrelated service attempting to use an API key.
* **Solution:**
    * **Trace Usage:** Search the codebase (especially `KVConfigStore.ts`, `ConfigurationService.ts`, `configAuthMiddleware.ts`, and any code directly using `env.IMAGE_CONFIGURATION_STORE`) for reads of `env.API_KEY`.
    * **Check Config API Auth:** Determine if the `API_KEY` is required specifically for authenticating requests to your `/api/config` endpoint when `DISABLE_CONFIG_AUTH` is false. If so, ensure the key is correctly set as a secret (`wrangler secret put API_KEY`) for your production environment.
    * **Remove if Unused:** If the key is not needed for KV access (which is likely) and not needed for the Config API (or if the API is disabled/not used in production), remove the code that attempts to read `env.API_KEY` to eliminate the warning.
* **Impact:** Cleans up unnecessary warnings and ensures configuration related to authentication keys is correct.

By implementing steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, you should see noticeable improvements in performance (especially for `format=json` requests) and cleaner production logs.
